# Features Implemented in the Final Project for Fundamentals of Software Engineering

## Authentication:

* Added a feature to reset the password for a user in case a user forgot his password: The user just has to go to the signup page add his username and the new password and click on reset password.
* Added a feature to make passwords more secure by adding format requirements so that users select good passwords only.
* Added a feature to restrict usernames to be made up of only alphanumeric characters and underscores(_).
* Here are the steps which user can take to make use of this Authentication feature:-
1. Go to the signup page.
2. There are three input fields for username, password and email. User is prompted the required format for the username and password while entering text into their respective input fields.
3. Username and password are required fields while email is not.
4. If the user does not follow the format for the two fields aand clicks somewhere else on the screen, he is prompted that an invalid username or password was entered based on what field was incorrect.
5. Untill the user enters a username and password that follows the correct formats the signup and reset buttons are disabled so that the user is unable to use less secure passwords, or invalid usernames.
6. As soon as the correct format username and secure password is entered the user can either click on the signup button to create a new username or reset an existing user's (user with the entered username) password. This will redirect you to the Home page and show you all the tuits.
